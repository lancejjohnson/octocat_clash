# Octocat Clash

Octocat Clash is a battle of GitHub users!

The idea for this app ~~was shamelessly stolen from~~ comes from the excellent
course at [React.js
Program](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals)

A user can provide two GitHub users and let them battle it out for GitHub
supremacy.

Really, it's a fun way to get some practice writing a Phoenix application.

## Phoenix Stuff

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
